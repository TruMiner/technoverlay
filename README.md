This is the overlay for the Technoblade r/place art that I made. Technoblade never dies!

### HOW TO INSTALL THE /R/TECHNOBLADE OVERLAY SCRIPT:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Step 1:
https://violentmonkey.github.io/get-it/

2Ô∏è‚É£ Step 2:
Install this script: 
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/TruMiner/technoverlay/main/technoblade%20never%20dies.user.js (its the same script thats in the repository above)


‚û°Ô∏è Once done, your /r/place canvas should display colored dots in the center of pixels that are miscolored according to /r/technoblade's templates. The outside color is the actual pixel color, the inside color is the desired pixel color.

üóíÔ∏è NOTE: If you are having trouble getting the overlay to work and you use a dark reader extension, try turning that off.

‚ö†Ô∏è DISCLAIMER: This script only overlays pixel art design onto the /r/place canvas for reference. It does not place any pixels automatically. You can inspect the code yourself. We actively discourage automated pixel placement.
