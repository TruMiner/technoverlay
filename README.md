### HOW TO INSTALL THE /R/TECHNOBLADE OVERLAY SCRIPT:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Step 1:
https://violentmonkey.github.io/get-it/

2Ô∏è‚É£ Step 2:
Install this script: 
https://github.com/TruMiner/technoverlay/raw/main/technoblade%20never%20dies%202.user.js (if you want the old script, you can get the old one above)


‚û°Ô∏è Once done, your /r/place canvas should display colored dots in the center of pixels that are miscolored according to /r/technoblade's templates. The outside color is the actual pixel color, the inside color is the desired pixel color.

üóíÔ∏è NOTE: If you are having trouble getting the overlay to work and you use a dark reader extension, try turning that off.

‚ö†Ô∏è DISCLAIMER: This script only overlays pixel art design onto the /r/place canvas for reference. It does not place any pixels automatically. You can inspect the code yourself. We actively discourage automated pixel placement.

### REPOSITORY INFORMATION

üíª technoblade never dies.user.js and technoblade never dies 2.user.js are the scripts themselves.

üé® the images folder contains current.png and current2.png. these are the overlay images for the original script and the 2nd version.

üñºÔ∏è there are 2 current images and that is because i didn't want to break compatibility for the original when the canvas expanded. if there was just one, then the old one would be weirdly stretched.

üìÅ the all folder contains all the overlays that have been used for both of the current.png's.
